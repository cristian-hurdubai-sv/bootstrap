### 1. What is backstage
    - Backstage can be described as a framework for building various applications.
    - It can be considered a tool that helps create and manage software projects.
    - It can be extended with plugins built by the community and as well built internally.

### 2. What does backstage do, achieve?
It provides a set of common apis and it has a pluggable architecture that helps expanding its functionality even further.

### 3. Key points
    - IDP - Internal Developer Portal: It unifies all your toolings, services, app, docs, data into one single portal.
    - Presents a summary of everyhthing available in your ecosystem, regardless of what individual components are running
    - Let company employees focus on what they do best.

### 4. Why considering backstage?
    1. Velocity:
        - Spawning a boilerplate application for a new starting team to develop software. (create new service, API, website etc)
        - Getting people fast on track with what current application is doing (All documentation is available into one single point of contact; there is no need to "search" for in different places)
        - Checking logs; verify pipelines...
        - Onboard new people.
    2. Extendibility:
        - Can be easily extended by adding community and/or self-developed plugins. Backstage has a decoupled architecture
    3. Organized system:
        - Getting to know what teams are responsible for which software is a always good thing.
        - One centralized software catalog


### 5. What are the main features of backstage out of the box
    - Creates new software in a matter of seconds (templating)
    - Manage all software in one centralized portal (catalog)
    - Explore the entire ecosystem of an "entity" (catalog/entity details).

### 6. Backstage Architecture
    - Core (functionality developed by the backstage)
    - App (an instance of a backstage app deployed on your end)
    - Plugins (additional functionality added to suit your needs)

### 7. Type of plugins
    - Frontend
    - Backend
    - Proxy (for extending existing plugins)

### 8. Diasdvantages
    - TBD
